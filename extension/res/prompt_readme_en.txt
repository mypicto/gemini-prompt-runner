# Prompt Runner for Google Gemini

This extension allows automatic execution of prompts, which is not supported by default, by passing additional URL parameters to the Google Gemini web app.

## Features

* Automatic prompt execution via URL parameters (parameters are not sent to the server and are processed securely within the browser)
  * Replacement of the keyword `{{clipboard}}` in prompts with clipboard text (optional)
  * Automatic prompt submission (optional)
* Model selection via URL parameters
* Generation of URLs usable in Prompt Runner for Google Gemini from the current prompt and selected model
* Copying of the last response when `Ctrl + C` / `Cmd + C` is pressed without text selection (requires a copy button, so a certain window size is necessary)


## Use Cases

* Register prompt templates in bookmarks
* Trigger prompt execution from CLI

## Instructions

```plaintext

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ext-q` | Prompt string to execute | URL-encoded text (insert clipboard text with `{{clipboard}}` keyword) |
| `ext-m` | Index of the model to select | Integer starting from 0 (order as displayed in UI) or model name (as displayed in UI) |
| `ext-clipboard` | Replace the {{clipboard}} keyword in `ext-q` with the clipboard text | `true/false` or `0/1` |

> By enabling `ext-send` and specifying multiple `ext-q` values, you can send multiple prompts consecutively.
